In this example, we:

Specify the file path (you should replace "output.txt" with the actual path where you want to write the file).
Create a FileWriter to open the file for writing.
Use the write() method to write text to the file.
Close the FileWriter to save and close the file.
Remember to handle exceptions properly, as shown in both examples, to deal with any potential issues during file reading and writing.
