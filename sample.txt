Hi rishabh

In this example, we:

Specify the file path (you should replace "sample.txt" with the actual path of the file you want to read).
Create a FileReader to open the file for reading.
Create a BufferedReader to efficiently read lines from the file.
Use a while loop to read lines from the file until there are no more lines (indicated by readLine() returning null).
Close the resources to release them properly.
